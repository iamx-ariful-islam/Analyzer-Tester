## Task Description

A project to build a Python-based medical analyzer tester for continuously receive analyzer data. Here analyzer tester communicate with any medical analyzer base on ip address with port no for network communication or com port with baudrate for serial communication with bytes size and connection mode. analyzer tester continuously try to create unidirectional or bidirectional connection with bytes size if connect then receive data and show into the terminal and you can write that data into [TXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file) file. Here are some special features added.

* **Running time clock**
* **Bidirectional/Unidirectional mode**
* **Generate txt file**
